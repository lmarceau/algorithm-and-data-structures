# Algoritm and data structures
Algorithm and data structures in Swift to practice. This isn't of course an exhaustive list, but you gotta start somewhere right? Some problems where taken from Daily Coding Challenge, while other comes from HackerRank or other random websites.

## Acknowledgement
Some solutions here are based on the repository [Swift Algorithm Club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club). This repository exists to practice and keep track of my progress. Not going to reinvent the wheel here you know.
