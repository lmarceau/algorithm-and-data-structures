# Algoritm and data structures
Algorithm and data structures in Swift to practice. This isn't of course an exhaustive list, but you gotta start somewhere right?

## Acknowledgement
Some solutions here are based on the repository [Swift Algorithm Club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) problems. This repository exists to practice and keep track of my progress. Not going to reinvent the wheel here you know.
